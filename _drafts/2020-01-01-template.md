Today, July 17, 2020, we are announcing the launch of the Go FAIR US website. The [GO FAIR Professional Development Workshop](https://uc3.cdlib.org/2020/04/17/advancing-fair-and-go-fair-in-the-u-s-notes-from-the-workshop/) (February 25-27, 2020) highlighted a need to create a place to connect FAIR stakeholders and foster a community where FAIR approaches can be shared, discussed, and advanced collaboratively. We see the website playing this central role to furthering [our goals](https://go-fair-us.github.io/about/).

Want to [get involved](https://go-fair-us.github.io/get-involved/)? There are number of options including our [email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gofairus) and [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/gofair/signup). If you have US FAIR-related news and/or events to share, see [how you can contribure](https://github.com/go-fair-us/go-fair-us.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/contributing-instructions.md). Or [reach out to us](mailto:christine@sdsc.edu&cc=mcragin@sdsc.edu, erdmannc@renci.org,Juliane_Schneider@hms.harvard.edu&subject=Go%20FAIR%20US%20Inquiry) if you would like to become a partner. 

Special thank you to Henry Chan, a software engineering intern at ServiceNow (previously with SDSC) for helping our team develop the website. 

We hope this website along with associated communication channels will inspire further FAIR-related efforts in the US.
