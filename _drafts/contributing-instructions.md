### Drafting and formatting content

Our news & events content is formatted in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and rendered by Jekyll as HTML. 

We recommend three options to format your content in Markdown:

- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)
- [Docs to Markdown](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Contributing news & events posts

1.  Draft posts go in the `drafts` folder

1.  Copy and use the news and events [template]() for your post

1.  The file name of your draft must use the following format:
    
    `YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md`
    
    e.g. 
    
    `2020-01-01-advancing-fair-news-event.md`
    
1.  Posts will not render without a header. See the news and events [template]() for an example.

1.  Images should be uploaded to the `assets/img/news` or `assets/img/events`folders. Images should be linked using Markdown, and paths to the image should be relative. 
    
    Example: 
    ```md
    ![Image Description](../assets/img/news/image.jpg)
    ```
    For images hosted elsewhere, include the full link to the image and check whether you have permission to use it.

### Writing Tips

- Know your audience. Who are you speaking to?
- Focus on what your core message is and use the keywords that you think people will use to search for your post.
- Include key dates and locations and highlight them at the beginning of your post. 
- Why should the people you are writing to care about your post? Highlight what you think is most important.
- Be succinct and less verbose. Reread and Edit as much as possible. As a general rule, try to not write anything beyond 5 paragraphs. People have little time to read long posts. Consider using bullet points.
- Always try to include an image as humans are very visual. Make sure you have permission to use the image. Sites like [CC0 Search](https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/) and/or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) are options if you do not have an image.

### Add your draft

1. In the `drafts` folder, select `Create New File`. If you are not a member of the repository, GitHub tells you that you do not have ‘write’ access. A new file will be saved under your copy of the project (‘fork’) and can later be merged with a ‘pull request’.

1. Add the file name from above, e.g. `2020-01-01-advancing-fair-news-event.md`
    
1. Copy the file contents (based on the news and events template) into the `Edit new file` text box. 

1. Select `Propose new file` at the bottom of the page, when you are finished editing

1. Select `Create Pull Request` if you are not able to merge. You can add additional comments to your pull request

1. Wait for a member to review, provide additional comments, and ultimately merge the file into `news` or `events`.
