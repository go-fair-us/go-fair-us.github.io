Thank you for those that joined us for the April 2020 Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN) series where participants and presenters explored the intersection of COVID-19 and related topics from building training capacities of data stewards in Africa, to Fair Data Points (FDP), and various approaches and resources available for mining heterogeneous datasets.VODAN is a [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) implementation network setup to help fight COVID-19, and set foundations for future virus-based health crises.

Slides are linked per session below. Recordings are available on the [SDSC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Gm75ukCI8FW_w6F8tAWLg).
