Save the date! On October 15 9:00-10:00 PT ([check your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201015T16)) Go FAIR US will kick off a webinar series on FAIR. The initial webinar will introduce the Go FAIR initiative, provide background on the FAIR Principles, how they are being applied, and what training efforts are underway. We will also discuss next steps on how we can grow the FAIR community in the US. At the webinar, we will also announce upcoming events in the Go FAIR webinar series. As the event approaches we will provide further information on registration. See you there!
