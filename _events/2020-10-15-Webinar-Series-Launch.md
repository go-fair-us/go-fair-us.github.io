Save the date! On October 15 9:00-10:00 PT ([check your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201015T16)) GO FAIR US will kick off a webinar series on FAIR. The initial webinar will introduce the GO FAIR initiative, and provide a FAIR basics overview: what are the FAIR Data Principles, how you can apply them (or not) and what you can do to 'FAIR-'ize your data that causes the least amount of pain but has the most effect. In addition, we will announce upcoming events in the GO FAIR webinar series.

You can register for the event here: <br />
