Save the date! On October 15 9:00-10:00 PT ([check your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201015T16)) Go FAIR US will kick off a webinar series on FAIR. The initial webinar will introduce the Go FAIR initiative, provide background on the FAIR Principles, some ways in which they are being applied, and what training efforts are underway. We will also discuss next steps on how we can grow the FAIR community in the US and how you can get involved. At the webinar, we will also announce upcoming events in the Go FAIR webinar series. As the event approaches we will provide further information on registration. See you there!   

If there is a FAIR topic you would like us to cover, or a FAIR based project you would like to present through a Go FAIR US webinar, contact us through @gofairus on Twitter, our Google Group, or the form on our [Contact Us](https://gofair.us/get-involved/) page.
