Join your colleagues for the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Virtual Plenary 17 event, happening 20-23 April, 2021.  RDAâ€™s plenary meetings provide an opportunity for members from 145 countries to gather and address global challenges and broker solutions that work within different contexts. The plenaries allow participants to engage with the international community, connect online and collaborate with colleagues globally, and remotely attend an event, minimizing time investment and eliminating travel costs.
 
Plenary 17 in Edinburgh will focus on the themes of global challenges, global mechanisms for data reuse, sustainable solutions with benefits for all, and global cooperation to realise these ends.
 
The event includes keynote presentations, 90+ breakout sessions, panel discussions, poster and networking sessions and Scottish-themed social activities!
