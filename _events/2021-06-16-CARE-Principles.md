On Wednesday June 16, 2021, <a href = "https://www.earthcube.org/">EarthCube</a> hosted a workshop event at 1:00 PM PST / 4 pm EST / 8 pm UTC. This event directly followed the GO FAIR US <a href="https://gofair.us/events/2021-06-16-FAIR-Workflows.html">FAIR Workflows Webinar</a> on June 16th. 

**Dr. Lydia Jennings** from the University of Arizona discussed the relationship between CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and FAIR Principles. She was joined by Moderator **Amy Myrbo** from Amiable Consulting.  

**Abstract** <br>
Concerns about secondary use of data and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.
