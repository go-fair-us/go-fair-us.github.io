On June 16, 2021, the GO FAIR US Team hosted a webinar on FAIR Workflows at 12 pm PST / 3 pm EST / 7 pm UTC.

**Carole Goble and Frederik Coppens** discussed steps towards FAIR principles for computational tools and workflows and how these are supported by the tool-suite of the European EOSC-Life Research Infrastructure Cluster. During the webinar they showed how [WorkflowHub.eu](https://workflowhub.eu/), their registry of workflows, uses community-driven metadata standardisation efforts (CWL, Bioschemas, RO-Crate) for describing and exchanging workflows, operates with an ecosystem of registries, and supports integration with workflow management systems,  and execution platforms.  

**Denis Yuen and Beth Sheets** discussed how [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/), a computational tool and workflow sharing site, attempts to help researchers increase the portability and reproducibility of their work. During this webinar, they discussed their features that promote FAIRness, their best practices for FAIR workflows, prominent work or communities on Dockstore, and standardization efforts like GA4GH TRS.
