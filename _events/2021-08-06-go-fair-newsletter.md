The GO FAIR US Team is excited to announce the launch of our newsletter! We will keep you, our community members and partners, up-to-date on GO FAIR US Office, as well as with news and events across the global GO FAIR Community. You can subscribe to the newsletter by clicking on the button below.

GO FAIR US serves in a coordination, outreach, and dissemination role, leveraging the deep, cross-cutting expertise of the Office team, key partners, and our growing member network. Our organizational and newsletter structure is modeled after GO FAIR's 3 pillars: Build (Technology), Change (Policy, Culture), and Train(ing). There is a recognized gap of available experts, especially with domain expertise. We've added a fourth key area we call Ambassadors, to help identify experts and to build and grow the data stewardship capacity in the US.
