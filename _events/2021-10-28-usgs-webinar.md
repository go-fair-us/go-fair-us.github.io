On October 28th, 2021 at 9 am PST/12 pm EST/5 pm UTC, GO FAIR US hosted a webinar on how USGS has utilized the GO FAIR Pillars in their roadmap for enabling FAIR Data. <b>Viv Hutchinson</b> gave a talk titled: “Mapping GO FAIR Pillars to the new USGS Roadmap for enabling FAIR Data.”

<b>Abstract:</b>

In 2019, the USGS Community for Data Integration (CDI) funded development of a roadmap to facilitate the production and release of more FAIR data in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The resulting roadmap recommends nine interdependent strategies, addressed through coordinated actions taken by multiple organizational areas of the USGS, that focus on enabling improvements to individual data products, providing infrastructure, and defining administrative activities to support an organizational culture that understands and values FAIR. The recommended actions are consistent with the three pillars of GOFAIR, including improvements to USGS policies and training, development and implementation of improved technology, and investigation of opportunities to align employee incentives that encourage FAIR.
