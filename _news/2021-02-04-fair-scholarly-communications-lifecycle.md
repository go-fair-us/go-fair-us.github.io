On [22 January 2021](https://dknet.org/about/webinar/2140), and 01 February 2021, I presented on the topic of "FAIR Data & Software in the Scholarly Communications Lifecycle" to [dkNET](https://dknet.org/) and the [Research Triangle Institute (RTI)](https://www.rti.org/). The presentation (see [slides](https://github.com/go-fair-us/go-fair-us.github.io/blob/master/assets/slides/2021-02-01-fair-scholarly-communications-lifecycle.pdf)) is a slimmed down version of a much longer session that is run at the [Force11 Scholarly Communications Institute](https://www.force11.org/fsci/2019) (see [Zenodo record and slides](https://zenodo.org/record/3987052#.YBruU5NKhfU)). 

I was able to ask the two communities the same set of questions below:

- What is motivating you to learn more about FAIR?
- How are you responding to the [principles](https://gofair.us/principles/)? Particularly the F1 and R1.3 principles.
- Are there [#FAIRexamples](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FAIRexamples) you've found helpful?

You can find the answers from the participants in the [collaborative notes](https://github.com/go-fair-us/go-fair-us.github.io/new/master/assets/slides/2021-02-01-fair-scholarly-comms-notes.md). In addition, if you have [#FAIRexamples](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FAIRexamples) to share, please use the Twitter hashtag.

A recording from the dkNET presentation is available at:
