The Advancing FAIR in North America meeting was held from February 25-27 at GA Tech, Coda, Atlanta... organized by SDSC... with support from NSF... to learn about FAIR, share experiences, build a network... subsequent report is coming along with some community inivitiaves... in addition to the experiences that were shared at the meeting, we would like to reach out to the community, to see if there is FAIR-related material you would like to share which you've used to communicate/teach...
