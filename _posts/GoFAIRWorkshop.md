# Go FAIR Workshop

## Atlanta, Georgia, February 25-27, 2020

Everybody knows the [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples), am I right? Those things everyone talks about, writes about, references whenever data management comes up?

But what do they mean? 

They are not rules.
They are not a standard.
They are not a requirement.
They do not require open access to data.

They **are** guidelines towards best data practice.

What do we - researchers, data curators, librarians, technologists - **do** with these things?

In the slightly panic-tinged miasma that is the research data management discussion, the FAIR Data Principles are a way of reaching for best practices, coming to a convergence on what those are, and how to get there.

A workshop, held February 25-27, 2020, to address how to support FAIR in the United States was organized by the [GO FAIR USA office](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/go-fair-offices/go-fair-usa-office/).

The workshop goals:

Facilitate development of a community of practice for FAIR awareness and capacity-building in the U.S.;
Improve understanding of FAIR technologies, and how to teach this to others; and,
Preparation for teaching or supporting FAIR data management and policies for researchers, local institutions, professional organizations, and others.

[GO FAIR Europe](https://www.go-fair.org/), represented by Albert Mons (Phortos Consulting), and Luiz Bonino and Erik Schultes (GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO)), gave an overview of how their organization works to support and foster the growth of data practices and training that adhere to the FAIR Data Principles.

Building on the European work, the group, consisting of librarians, data scientists and scientific data curators, discussed how fostering FAIR data practices would best be encouraged, and what kind of structure could be built in institutions to make this happen.

There were presentations on different aspects of FAIR, including experiences with doing a FAIR analysis of existing repositories, development of tools to assist in FAIR data practices, and experiences of FAIR training and events.

Research data is lonely, cut off from other data and the people who want to use it. Don't be lonely, data! Using the FAIR data principles in research data management (RDM) creates an excellent basis for connection. Researchers may not be able to get permission to a full dataset, but they will be able to discover it exists, and if permission is given, the dataset will be able to be accessed and reused through machine communication channels.

###FAIR Engagement

Many people know FAIR is there, but what about those that don't? And for those that do, how does the institution help them translate what applying FAIR to their own work means? And who is the translator?

Christine Kirkpatrick of SDSC gave an excellent presentation about how to drive cultural change, managing blind spots, and how to organize around collective impact models. And since the FAIR principles can only be effective within a community, how do we do together what we cannot do alone? How do we use the power of community to drive engagement and articulate why FAIR is important, andhow it rewards those who understand and use it?


### FAIR Implementation

How do you use FAIR? It's a set of principles, not an instruction guide. Several presentations were give on how FAIR was being translated into action.

**EOSC-Nordic FAIR Maturity evaluation of data repositories**

*Andreas O Jaunsen (NeIC, WP4 lead)*

This presentation featured the development of FAIR maturity indicators for repositories. The Maturity evaluator provides efficiency, scalability
and reproducibility through comparing datasets to the indicators, and measures FAIRness through machine-actionability.

**FAIR Digital Object Framework**

*Luiz Bonino (University of Twente)*

Currently under development, the FAIR Digital Object Framework is a model to represent objects in the digital space based on the FAIR principles and supporting machine actionability.

**Ontologies**

Several presentations stressed the importance of ontology use in FAIR-izing datasets. The use of ontologies when creating metadata for datasets enhance machine-actionability, consistency, interoperability and, when used in an RDF format, allow for persistency.


### FAIR Training

Some practical advice was given on creating FAIR training and workshops. 
Chris Erdmann shared his experiences with coordinating and instructing for  FAIR training, and Natalie Meyers presented a FAIR primer on holding an event/workshop. Christine Kirkpatrick gave an excellent and highly amusing presentation on pedagogy, and Nancy J. Hoebelheinrich presented on where we can find resources for finding training materials.

### Reflections

We spent a lot of time looking at what exists, especially through Go FAIR Europe, resources for training materials and discussions about what our institutions are currently doing and where opportunities for engagement exist. We also spend some time in reflection on assessing the data landscape, especially in the areas of:

 * capacity building
 * making progress
 * change, build, train
