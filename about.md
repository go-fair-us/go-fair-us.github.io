<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The GO FAIR US Support and Coordination Office is hosted by the <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/" title="San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)">San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)</a>, University of California San Diego. SDSC is involved in other related and high profile research data efforts, including the US National Science Foundation-funded <a href="https://westbigdatahub.org/" title="">West Big Data Innovation Hub</a> and the <a href="http://www.nationaldataservice.org/" title="US National Data Service (NDS)">US National Data Service (NDS)</a>. The US NDS, based at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, with Christine Kirkpatrick as Executive Director, was founded by a consortium that included academia, government, infrastructure providers, and non-profit institutions interested in creating and bridging evolving technologies and platforms that support the publication, discovery, andreuse of data. GO FAIR US was established in February 2019 as one of the first GO FAIR national offices, see the <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/News%20Items/PR20190228_RDS_GOFAIR.html" title="GO FAIR US Press Release">press release</a> announcing the office start along with the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Declaration-GO-FAIR-US.pdf" title="Go FAIR US Declaration">declaration.</a></p>

<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>The GO FAIR US Support and Coordination Office disseminates, supports and coordinates the recommendations and activities related to the adoption of the GO FAIR implementation networks within the United States and its territories. GO FAIR US focuses on all knowledge domains and the general goal of increasing FAIR data stewardship; the values and goals of GO FAIR are complementary to the aims of other data initiatives and memberships including NDS, and the NSF Big Data Hubs. This synergy was enshrined in the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/2020/03/30/data-together-statement/" title="2020 Data Together Statement">2020 Data Together Statement</a> issued by GO FAIR, CODATA, WDS, and the Research Data Alliance. SDSC has a rich history of providing the latest in techniques and technologies for supporting data-driven discovery and research. The GO FAIR partnership provides a strategic way to develop the US research data stewardship ecosystem through partnerships with local industry on training and techniques that make data more accessible to people and machines.
  
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Within the general guidelines for involvement in GO FAIR at the country/region level, the US Office, commits to the following activities in the context of science and innovation:

<ul>
<li>Connect and partner with FAIR stakeholders, e.g. researchers, infrastructure providers, institutions, publishers, agencies, industry, libraries, and funders.</li>
<li>Highlight and foster community discussions on the topic of FAIR. For example, FAIR in AI, software, data science, model commons, new scholarship methods, e.g. notebooks.</li>
<li>Be a place where FAIR training and assessment approaches and material can be shared and advanced collaboratively.</li>
<li>Liaise with <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/go-fair-offices/">GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO)</a>.</li>
<li>Build awareness of <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/" title="GO FAIR Implementation Network (IN)">GO FAIR Implementation Network (IN)</a> activities in the US and worldwide.</li>
<li>Respond rapidly to evolving needs, such as integration and expansion of the Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN).</li>
</ul>
