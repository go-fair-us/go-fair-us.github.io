The GO FAIR USA Support and Coordination office is hosted by the US National Data Services (NDS) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), University of California San Diego. The US NDS was founded by a consortium that included academia, government, infrastructure providers, and non-profit institutions interested in creating and bridging evolving technologies and platforms that support the publication, discovery, and reuse of data. GO FAIR USA was established in February 2019 as one of the first GO FAIR national offices, see a press release announcing the office start.

Main focus & activities
The GO FAIR US Support and Coordination Office will disseminate, support and coordinate the decisions and activities related to the adoption of the GO FAIR implementation strategies within the United States and its territories.

GO FAIR US will focus on all knowledge domains and the general goal of increasing FAIR data stewardship, the values and goals of GO FAIR are complementary to the aims of NDS. SDSC has a rich history of providing the latest in techniques and technologies for supporting data-driven discovery and research. Located on the La Jolla mesa, SDSC is surrounded by over 600 biotech companies; the GO FAIR partnership provides a strategic way to partner with local industry on training and techniques that make data more accessible to people and machines.

Within the general guidelines for involvement in GO FAIR at the country/region level, the US Office, commits to the following activities in the context of science and innovation:

Support and coordinate GO FAIR Implementation Networks in the USA according to their specific goals in adopting the implementation strategies collectively defined by the GO FAIR initiative;
Support and coordinate Implementation Networks that are willing to define strategies and guidelines for the implementation of the FAIR principles, in the cases where these strategies are missing;
Review and consolidate the existing implementation strategies/guidelines and the ones created by the supported Implementation Networks, ensuring that they follow the Rules of Engagement
Develop outreach mechanisms for the implementation strategies defined by the Implementation Networks active in the GO FAIR initiative;
Keep intensive communication with the GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO) to:
inform international community about the activities supported and coordinated by GO FAIR US;
be informed of the activities supported and coordinated directly by GFISCO or by the other GO FAIR Regional Offices, and;
discuss with GFISCO how to align and optimize these activities.
Declaration
The US GO FAIR office is actively seeking partners to join in the declaration and suggest ways of building and connecting the US ecosystem for an Internet of FAIR data & services: GO FAIR US Declaration.
