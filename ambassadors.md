<h3> Ambassadors Initiative</h3>

<p> In addition to the three Pillars, a group called “Ambassadors'' will be established.  GO FAIR’s emphasis upon FAIR data  implementation within a FAIR data ecosystem will require domain specialists and consultants from academia, industry, and non-profits.  These participants in the data ecosystem will be vital to building this capacity. The Ambassadors are responsible for Identifying  data and/or domain specialists who will follow FAIR-related activities, as well as watch for new opportunities and duplicative work in their area of speciality. The Ambassador group will follow the same structure as the Pillars, choosing two high level priorities that are renewed or replaced every six months. The Chair(s) will work with an initial set of Ambassadors to establish a process for nominating and inviting domain ambassadors and for assessing the appropriate level of formality.  The Founding Chair will be Nancy Hoebelheinrich.
