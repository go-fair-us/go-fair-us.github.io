Collaborative notes from two sessions on [FAIR Data & Software in the Scholarly Communications Lifecycle](https://gofair.us/news/2021-02-04-fair-scholarly-communications-lifecycle.html) (22 January 2021 and 1 February 2021):

What is motivating you to learn more about FAIR?
- I see public data as a vast resource for biomedical research
- We support FAIR but the next question is how to achieve it practically
- Data sharing is important in my work  and we want our project to meet FAIR standards
- We have FAIR(ish) endpoints (for external consumption), but don't know how to integrate it into the modeling/storage of data
- I work with two NIH Consortiums and need collaboration with investigators within the US and internationally.

- Funder requirements in proposals
- Importance to NIH in research studies
- Requirements from clients
- Seems to be coming up more in proposals
- Important to internal and external projects
- Need to learn FAIR as more proposals are requesting its use
- Interested in learning the basics of FAIR as it keeps coming up 
- Understand basics, but want to stay in touch with latest and greatest as additional guidelines are developed
- Basis for well designed project to aggregate and share data
- Want data collected to maximize potential 
- Increasing the impact data can have on research
- Improvement in our current NIH funded tools 
- Reproducible research
- Understand more about 
- Enhance data sharing
- To provide informed support for our business development efforts.


How are you responding to the principles?

F1: (Meta) data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers

- For the most part, we've been doing what data repositories ask us to do. This is not very much, actually. And it is not clear how our IDs would be defined to be consistent with this.
- For  Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), our donors are identified with an RRID and data available to all investigators.  Within Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium (ISCC), we are beginning to build Datasets to share within the consortium and ultimately with the scientific community.
- We try to map terms that we use to existing ontology terms, and work with developers to create new terms where necessary

- URLs
- I see this happening on a project level, but would like to see more broad connections
- Feels currently client driven when required, otherwise not 

R1.3: (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

- This is a huge issue for us when we are on the other end -- when we want to consume data others have generated. Generally, others are not really addressing the question of reuse when they put stuff in public places. It requires some thinking on our part to imagine reuse by others, but we try to put in whatever we can think of.
- The ISCC research into Datasets is just beginning and need outside published data as a resource.
- dkNET is helping researchers to understand what standards are required for different types of data through our repository listing

- Clinical metadata standards are hugely improved in the last few years- OMOP, FHIR, LOINC
- Adopting existing community standards when possible, but many to choose from in some cases. 
- Efforts made to use existing standard forms for research data collection, based on domain specific standards
- Finding metadata standards are lacking
- Environmental health/ exposure metadata is totally missing
- Chemistry is a mess

- Love the Zenodo interface with GitHub!
- Docker containers have huge potential here- but I have not seen any best practices on how best to use containers for this purpose (see https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008316)
