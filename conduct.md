The Consortium is dedicated to **providing a harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Consortium members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions.
